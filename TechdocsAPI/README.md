# Techdocs: A code documentation generator

## Introduction

**Code Documentation Generation** is a tool that generates documentation for your code. It is a simple tool that can be used by anyone who wants to generate documentation for their code. It leverages the power of **OpenAI GPT-3, Huggingface Transformers, Langchain and Clarifai** to generate documentation for your code. 

To use the application, you need to provide your code as input. The tool will analyze your code and generate documentation for it. The documentation will include comments, descriptions, parameters, return values, examples, and more.

It is a useful tool for developers who want to document their code without spending too much time and effort. It can help you improve the readability, maintainability, and quality of your code. It can also help you share your code with others more easily.
